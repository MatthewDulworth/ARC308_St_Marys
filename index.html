            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
               Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, also known as Saint Mary's Cathedral, is located in the
               neighborhood of Cathedral Hill in San Francisco, California. The cathedral was built to replace the
               previous
               cathedral which burnt down in 1962. The initial design team included three local architects, Angus
               McSweeny,
               Paul A. Ryan, and John Michael Lee, but in an attempt to create something more untraditional two other
               prominent architects were brought on, Pietro Belluschi who was then the dean of architecture at MIT and
               Pier-Luigi Nervi a famous Italian architect. Work on Saint Mary's started in August of 1965 and was
               completed in 1970.

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
               Saint Mary's is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fransisco, and the seat of the
               Archbishop of San Francisco, Reverend Salvatore J. Cordileone (Sept. 2020). Its main function is for
               Catholic religious ceremonies, but often hosts concerts and other events, as well as serving as a
               community
               center for the surrounding parish.

               <h4>Modernism and American Mid-20th Century Sacred Architecture</h4>
               <p>
                  Chapter 5 of Modernism and American Mid-20th Century Sacred Architecture, by Gabrial Neri explores the
                  design of the cathedral. The architectural design of the building is rather unique, especially its use
                  of a
                  reinforced concrete hyperbolic paraboloid. The genesis for this project came about after the initial
                  designs
                  for the cathedral were rejected and the Archbishop brought on renowned architect Peitro Belluschi, to
                  come up with something new and unconventional. The architects went through a long experimental phase
                  trying to get the design to work before beginning construction in 1967. A striking quote from the chapter: 
                  <span class="quote">
                     "How would Michelangelo have thought of this cathedral? He could not have
                     thought of it. The design comes from geometric theories not yet proved. It could only have been
                     conceived of today."
                     <sup>[4]</sup>
                  </span>
               </p>
            </div>

            <h4>The Anatomy of Transition: Cathedral-Building and Social Justice in San Francisco</h4>
            The Anatomy of Transition: Cathedral-Building and Social Justice in San Francisco, explores the events
            leading up to the construction of Saint Mary’s, the design and construction process, and how it relates to
            social justice at the time. After the previous Saint Mary’s burned down, the Archbishop of San Francisco
            started a campaign to raise money for the cathedral and for the poor. Many members of the public, the press
            and some clergy believed that there was no need for a new cathedral, and that instead the diocese should use
            that money to help the poor. The Archbishop held that helping the poor and building a new cathedral were not
            mutually exclusive, and that they had enough funds to do both, and that the new cathedral would be home to
            new services to help the poor even further.
