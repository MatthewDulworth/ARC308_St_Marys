            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
               Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, also known as Saint Mary's Cathedral, is located in the
               neighborhood of Cathedral Hill in San Francisco, California. The cathedral was built to replace the
               previous
               cathedral which burnt down in 1962. The initial design team included three local architects, Angus
               McSweeny,
               Paul A. Ryan, and John Michael Lee, but in an attempt to create something more untraditional two other
               prominent architects were brought on, Pietro Belluschi who was then the dean of architecture at MIT and
               Pier-Luigi Nervi a famous Italian architect. Work on Saint Mary's started in August of 1965 and was
               completed in 1970.

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
               Saint Mary's is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fransisco, and the seat of the
               Archbishop of San Francisco, Reverend Salvatore J. Cordileone (Sept. 2020). Its main function is for
               Catholic religious ceremonies, but often hosts concerts and other events, as well as serving as a
               community
               center for the surrounding parish.
